* Lab Section Number: CST8116 311
* Professor Name: Mel Sanschagrin
* Description: This program is asking the user enter the size for a lumber 
* and it will output the lumber is good to use or not in console.
* will help visualize how fair an 8-sided dice is based on data obtained using a golf-ball test. 
* [1] Ideally each face of the dice should have an equal chance of appearing from a dice roll which is 1/8, 
* however if the dice is not balanced then it could give a game player an unfair advantage or disadvantage.
